# Paper-Reproducing
There are several goals of this long term "projects"
 1. The main goal here is to reproduce the code in papers that I am interested or that I feel important.
 2. While reproducing the code, I want to
    * improving my coding ability: summerize coding tricks/nuance
    * collecting research ideas: records the formulation of ideas paper to paper.
    * experimenting research ideas: summerize my own way of experiment
    * etc.
