#  Primary Goals: 
1. Reproducing the expriement from the paper **"Low-Rank Tensor Completion by Riemannian Optimization"** 
by Daniel Kressner, Michael Steinlechner, and Bart Vandereycken

2. Derive the math as much as possible

3. Compare my code with their code to improve my coding skills.(Record the difference)
