### Problem:

In the Reconstruction of Synthetic Data Sets (w/o noise) experiemnt. For my code to converge below error 1e-12, I need float64. But this gonna take more time than what they've shown in paper. Even though MPS does not support float64, their matlab code are much faster than my pytorch code, both of which are running on CPU. 



 Which part of my code can be improved?
